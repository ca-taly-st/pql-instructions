# Premier Quidditch League API

Welcome to the Premier Quidditch League API! This repository provides a mock REST API for the development and testing of a team and player management interface for the Premier Quidditch League.

This API is built using [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), which simulates a real server with minimal setup.
